Maintenance Management Kiosk Site

This site will be a general framework for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly maintenance for a facility. This should eventually link to a volunteer sign up page where volunteers can submit their skills, abilities, and experience. But for now, the goal is to establish this site in different stages:

Stage 1: Basic display of daily, weekly, momthly, and yearly tasks. 

Stage 2: Create an interactive checklist, that gets checked off daily, "signed", and submitted

Stage 3: Integrate with the volunteer sign-up page. 

More to come...
